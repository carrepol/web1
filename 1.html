<p>Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages, including Java,
JavaScript, Go, Node.js and C++.[13][14][15][16] <u>It is based on the Electron framework,</u>[17] which is used to develop
Node.js Web applications that run on the Blink layout engine. Visual Studio Code employs the same editor component
(codenamed "Monaco") used in Azure DevOps (formerly called Visual Studio Online and Visual Studio Team Services)</p>

<p>Instead of a project system, it allows users to open one or more directories, which can then be saved in workspaces for
future reuse. This allows it to operate as a language-agnostic code editor for any language.<br><br><br> It supports a number of
programming languages and a set of features that differs per language. Unwanted files and folders can be excluded from
the project tree via the settings. Many Visual Studio Code features are not exposed through menus or the user interface,
but can be accessed via the command palette.[19]</p>

<p>Visual Studio Code can be extended via extensions,[20] available through a central repository.<br> This includes additions
to the editor[21] and language support.[19] A notable feature is the ability to create extensions that add support for
new languages, themes, and debuggers, perform static code analysis, and add code linters using the Language Server
Protocol.[22]</p>

<p>Visual Studio Code includes multiple extensions for FTP, allowing the software to be used as a free alternative for web
development. Code can be synced between the editor and the server, without downloading any extra software.</p>

<p>Visual Studio Code allows users to set the code page in which the active document is saved, the newline character, and
the programming language of the active document. This allows it to be used on any platform, in any locale, and for any
given programming language. visual studio code allow user
